# Spotify Dataset Analysis with Python 🎧📊

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Spotify listening history and metadata to derive insights about music trends, listening behavior, track popularity, and more using Python.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **spotify_history.csv**: User listening history containing timestamped track data.
- **spotify_data_dictionary Description.csv**: Metadata and field descriptions for better context.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess Spotify data
- Analyze listening habits over time
- Discover top artists, tracks, and genres
- Understand track popularity and time trends
- Visualize insights using charts and graphs

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📒
- Pandas 🧮
- Matplotlib 📈
- Seaborn 🎨
- Datetime 🕒

---

## 📈 Key Analyses

- Most played songs and artists
- Daily/weekly/monthly listening patterns
- Listening time distribution (hour of day, day of week)
- Popularity vs track duration analysis
- Audio feature exploration (if applicable)

---

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Tasks

- Converted timestamps to datetime format
- Filled or removed missing values
- Extracted useful time-based features
- Merged metadata (if any) for enhanced insights

---
